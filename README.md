# Space Crypto Farming bot

### en

This project is an enhanced "fork" from two repositories on git

- https://github.com/sCryptoHelp/spacecrypto-bot
  and
- https://github.com/cryptotwinsbr/spacecrypto-bot

**I don't know who copied who, but you can follow the original code written there.**

I did a lot of changes around image search algorigthm that seems better and easier for me.
I've used the pyautogui native functions to search images on screen for example, the original code from those repositories is complex and hard to maintain.

If you use and want to buy me a coffe, you can send something in this address :)
